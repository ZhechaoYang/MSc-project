# MSc-project
This project would mainly based on this piece of the work, engaging to implement the discretisationand iterative solver under fully-discrete condition,  i.e discrete points in both physical domain andgeostrophic domain.  Using the theory given by the book ’Computational Optimal Transport’, aso-called barycentric projection map can be formed between the physical domain and geostrophicdomain  and  this  map  can  help  the  study  on  our  model,  especially  the  formation  of  the  front.  (ifpossible) Moreover, our method will also be compared with the geometric method obtained using thesemi-Lagrangian scheme to see its advantages and disadvantages.
